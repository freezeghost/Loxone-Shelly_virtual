# Loxone-Shelly_virtual
Set of Shelly virtual inputs and outputs directly conectable to loxone. Not needed any 3rd party connector.<br>
<br>
All provided files was tested (my private needs) and maybe some of inputs/outputs transitions need to be corrected. Maximum values are corrected and all tested.<br>
<br>
XML files goes into directories<br>
INPUTS marked VI/VIU "your user documents/Loxone\Loxone Config\Templates\VirtualIn"<br>
OUTPUTS marked VO "your user documents/Loxone\Loxone Config\Templates\VirtualOut"<br>
Inputs VIU are for requesting via UDP port which must be correctly set in Shelly. Usually it is used by new generation os shelly.<br>
Recomend is to set separate port for each device, it is more easy to hook data.<br>
<br>
PLEASE CONSIDER<br>
I don't take any warranty of code, you are using it at your own responsibility!<br>
<br>
All files are free for any usage type
